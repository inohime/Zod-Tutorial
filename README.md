# Zod Tutorial

My solutions for ![Total Typescript](https://totaltypescript.com): ![Zod Tutorial](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/zod)

## Quickstart

```sh
# Installs all dependencies
yarn install

# Starts the first exercise
yarn exercise 01

# Runs linting and tests on the solution
yarn solution 01
```

## How to take the tutorial

You'll notice that the tutorial is split into exercises. Each exercise is split into a `*.problem.ts` and a `*.solution.ts`.

To take an exercise:

1. Go into `*.problem.ts`
2. Run `yarn exercise 01`, where `01` is the number of the exercise you're on.

The `exercise` script will run TypeScript typechecks and a test suite on the exercise.!

You can run `yarn solution 01` to run the tests and typechecking on the solution.
